My Introduction

Hello everyone,

I am a college student and a soldier who has recently figured out that I love coding.  I have always enjoyed computers and over the past years I found myself very interested in software.  It started with rooting my first phone because I was bored since then, I have been trying to further my knowledge in the cyber field and have switched my degree to cybersecurity.  I am excited to learn more and advance my understanding in this field.
